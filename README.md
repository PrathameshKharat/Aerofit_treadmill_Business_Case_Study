**Recommendations:**
* Target Upper income groups:
Median Income of Aerofit customers is 48891 USD which says that Aerofit customers fall into lower to middle income group in the American Economic Class system according to this article: https://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/family-finance/articles/where-do-i-fall-in-the-american-economic-class-system. Also 88% of Aerofit customers fall in Lower to Middle Income group (customized group based on Aerofit dataset) i.e., from 29K to 75K USD.
So, Aerofit should target to have considerable customer base from Upper Income groups maybe by launching a high-end product or marketing more to high-income people.
* Increase sales among female customers
* 42% of Aerofit customers are females and also, we have seen males are mostly using the Aerofit treadmills per week. Percentage of females using the Aerofit treadmills more than 3 days per week is very low compared to males.
* It has been observed that Males have rated themselves higher in fitness with 3.5 rating compared to females with 3.0 rating
* As age is increasing females are clocking less miles than males. Thereâ€™s a considerable dip in miles run/walk in 40-50 years females when compared to males.
So, Aerofit should focus on how to increase their sales to females more, maybe through advertising and also customizing/launching products suitable for females especially elderly females.
* Increase KP781 sales and bring it at par with other products
* KP781 sales is only at 22.22%.
* A huge difference has been observed between males and females using the KP781 treadmill.
* KP781 is not a popular product among females as only 3.89% females are buying it and probability that the purchase will be KP781 given that the customer is female is only 9.21%.
* So Aerofit should inspect on why KP781 sales is very low among females and take necessary action to make it more suitable for both male and female customers.
* Also KP781 is the least favorite among middle-aged adults (30-39 years) as they are using the other 2 products almost equally.
* Probability that the purchase will be KP781 given that the customer is a Middle-Aged Adult stands at only 16% while the other 2 products KP281 and KP481 stands at 40% and 44% respectively. Even though middle-aged adults are in Middle or Upper income groups they are not preferring KP781 product So Aerofit should target middle-age adults between the age bracket 30-39 years to increase their KP781 sales.
* It has been observed that KP781 is being used by highly educated, belonging to upper income and fitness enthusiast/professional customers, so they should market this as their premium model and target this customer profile more.
* Boost KP481 sales among fitness-conscious customers
* KP481 treadmill is a premium model than KP281, but the average fitness rating of the customers using KP481(2.9) is little bit lower than KP281(2.96). In fact it is the lowest as KP781 average fitness rating is 4.62. So, it seems like there is some problem with this product where fitness enthusiasts or professionals are avoiding this product.
* Aerofit should do some survey, get customer feedback from these fitness-conscious (fitness rating 4 and 5) customers about any issues with this product and take necessary action to make it more popular among these customers.
